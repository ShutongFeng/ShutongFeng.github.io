I am a PhD student in the Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group at [Chair for Dialog System and Machine Learning, Heinrich Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html). My work focuses on emotions in task-oriented dialogue. I am interested in how emotions are elicited and expressed in task-oriented dialogues, recognising these emotions, and improving task completion with emotion information.
